# Just-Another-Text-Editor

## Description

With Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E) you can write code or text on the go without worrying about an internet connection. This application handles data from the editor so that when you connect to the internet, your browser version is synced with your app version. This is done with a service worker, which handles caches and cookies, and an indexed database that keeps track of your latest additions to the text editor.

## Installation

If you are deploying the application from a local environment, you need to run "npm run build" and "npm install" in the console to install dependencies. Then use "node server.js" to open the server and access the website on a web browser using the specified entry port. The application allows you to install a desktop version that you can use anytime by clicking on the install button in the nav bar.

## Usage

All you need to do is write text on the numbered lines, which simulate the environment of a text editor. Using the text editor, you can write code for later or annotate code that might be useful for later. The install button gives you access to a desktop version that you can use anytime and is automatically synced with the browser version. Neither version requires a permanent internet connection and changes can be saved by clicking on install.
